title: "Reconstruction Algorithms for DNA-Storage Systems"
excerpt: "Implementations of reconstruction algorithms for DNA Storage Systems. 
A DNA reconstruction algorithm is a mapping which receives t traces y1, …, yt as an input and produces x^, an estimation of x. The goal in the DNA reconstruction problem is to minimize the edit distance between the original string and the algorithm’s estimation. For the deletion channel case, the problem is referred by the deletion DNA reconstruction problem and the goal is to minimize the Levenshtein distance."
