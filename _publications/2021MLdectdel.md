**Abstract** 

This paper studies the error probability of maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding for a special case of the deletion channel, referred by the **$t$-deletion channel**, which deletes exactly $t$ symbols of the transmitted word uniformly at random. The goal of the paper is to understand how an ML decoder operates in order to minimize the average decoding **error** probability (as opposed to the average decoding **failure** probability). A full characterization of the ML decoder for this setup is given for a channel that deletes one or two symbols, that is, $t=1,2$. For $t=1$ it is shown that if the code is the entire space then the ML decoder is the **lazy decoder** which simply returns the channel output. Similarly, for $t=2$ it is shown that the ML decoder acts as the lazy decoder in almost all cases and for the rest, when the longest run is significantly long, it prolongs the longest run by exactly one symbol.
